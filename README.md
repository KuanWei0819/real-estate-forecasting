🐳 Why Use Docker?
✅ 1. Portability
Your entire Airflow environment runs the same on any machine

No more “it works on my laptop” problems

✅ 2. Reproducibility
Everyone on your team gets the same environment with the same dependencies

No manual installs or package mismatches

✅ 3. Isolation
Keeps your Airflow, Python, and package setup completely separate from your local system

Avoids conflicts with other projects or Python environments

✅ 4. Modular Service Management
Airflow components (webserver, scheduler, database) each run in their own containers

Easier to monitor, debug, and scale

✅ 5. Ease of Setup
With docker-compose, you spin up everything (Airflow, Postgres, etc.) with one command:

docker-compose up
